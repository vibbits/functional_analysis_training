## ID mapping from Uniprot and Esemble

### 1- Using UniProt is possible to map ames and IDs back and forth, for a comprehensive number of organisms.

This activity is simple. Let's open the examples of data for [Plants]("../data/plant_example_Uniprot_IDmapping.txt") and [Humans]("../data/humans_example_Uniprot_IDmapping.txt").
One at a time we will copy and past in the [UniProt ID mapping retriever](https://www.uniprot.org/id-mapping).

There you can choose (1) from what source you get the names or IDs and, (2) to what database you want it to be mapped. 

For these examples we want to map from **UniProtKB AC/ID** to **UniprotKB** and the generated table needs to be download so we can use the information later. It my be good to know that the result is kept for **7 days** in their server.

# Functional analysis: The biology behind the genes

This 1 day training aims to show you some online tools that can help you discover the functions of your set of genes/proteins.
You can see the [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1oNKXqt5olJPhFVUUFHvxU1EUmfnFNhZMXreW0Q8ccKs/edit?usp=sharing) and activities. Or download it from the folder called [presentation]().

In the [data](https://github.com/vibbits/functional_analysis_training/tree/master/data) folder you can find **examples**, that are smaller samples with limited opportunities but fast processed data and; **exercises**, that are bigger data sets that you can do more with.

In the [activities](https://github.com/vibbits/functional_analysis_training/tree/master/activities) folder you can find the description of the activities done during the course and what dataset they use. ***p.s.: This session is not yet complete.***
